- Sign off in Slack at the end of your day, and shut down `pco-box`

- [ ] Make this thing a gem instead of a hand-rolled joby
- [ ] Use TTY components everywhere. Implement a base clase to inherit from like the TTY Command class.

  - create tmux session but don't attach, if needed: `tmux new-session -d -s foobar`
  - `ssh pco_box_cloud9 -t "tmux send-keys \"cd ~/pco-box && git pull\" Enter"`
