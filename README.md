Work Day
========

Start and end your workday at Planning Center with this handy little command line tool.

### Features

- Post a standup or normal message to your team's Slack channel.
- Update `pco-box`
- Update Planning Center apps to latest code
- Handles wip/unwip committing uncommitted work on feature branches, in case you forgot. This helps avoid annoying "Git borked..." messages when updating apps.
- Allows opening/closing additional apps for your workday, e.g. VSCode, Trello, etc.
- Sign off in Slack at the end of your day, and shut down `pco-box`

### Installation

1. Clone this repo to the location of your choice, and ideally, make sure it's in your `PATH`.
2. `bundle install`

### Setup

First, copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`.
